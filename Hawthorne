Making a change - not a merge conflict though

I'd put the story here, but I'd risk the plagiarism checker catching it...
A different line
I did a comparison between the Oval Portrait (Poe) and The Birthmark (Hawthorne).
Both had men whose obsessions killed their wives, unintentionally.

This is a similarity, even though one was obsessed with science, the other with art.
A difference is that the scientist's wife knew her life was at risk.

Apparently this was a popular comparison in class...

We'll see how my grade looks!
